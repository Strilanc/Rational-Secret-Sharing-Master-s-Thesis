   Second paragraph: In the presence of coalitions of players
                                     ^^

   Section 1.1: defined in this thesis.
                        ^^

** Page 2 (**)

   I think paragraphs 1 and 2 do not make the point strongly enough:
   paragraph 2 considers the scenario where it is *assumed* the players
   cooperate, while paragraph 1 talks about essentially *enforcing* that they
   cooperate because not doing so would not be in their interest.
   This is somewhat related to truthful mechanisms.

   Honest dealer: Returning to your bank analogy, do you think the assumption of
   an honest dealer is justified? ;)

** Page 4 (*****)

   I don't understand the second bullet on how to detect invalid shares.  Can
   you please elaborate.  What's the purpose of checking the entropy?  What are
   "shares matching the commitments"?

   Section 1.1.7, 1st paragraph: you may want to make a point that broadcast
   is the only viable option, as otherwise coalitions become too powerful.

** Page 5 (****)

   Can you explain what a "bit commitment" is and how it helps to make an
   inconspicuous secret conspicuous?

** Page 6

   2nd paragraph: relative to a player
                              ^

   Once a secret sharing protocol starts, the secret
                                        ^
   (Otherwise it sounds like the protocol starts the secret.)

* Chapter 2: Related work

  It would be very helpful to include a table that summarizes the most important
  characteristics of the different protocols discussed in this section.
  Otherwise the reader cannot keep track of the properties or combinations of
  properties that have been achieved by previous protocols and thus cannot
  appreciate the contribution of your thesis.

   Line 3: provided no information -> provide no information

   Middle of page: "If ..., then ..." requires a comma before "then"

   Bottom of page: Your argument here seems to assume that there are only three
   players.  You don't state this anywhere, though.

** Page 9

   Why will the other players stop participating if they don't receive anything?
   Follow-up: So essentially this protocol is only probabilistically bounded
   because if all flips come up tails, everybody stops participating and the
   protocol breaks down.

   Second paragraph: Any constraints on F and G here.  Are they fields?  Does
   G \ F mean set difference or something else?

   In both the Halpern/Teague and Gordon/Katz protocols, it seems that the
   goal is that everybody learns the secret.
   Where does the choice of t come into play?

** Page 10 (*****)

   Line 2: "Players send the next entry in their list." What's a player's list?
   You said the dealer generates the list.  I also do not understand the
   following description of the protocol at all.  What's a "short player"?

   Second paragraph, "If, then"
                        ^

   The Shareef paper (2nd last paragraph): Can you elaborate a little how this
   protocol is not trivially susceptible to coalitions and other misbehaviour?
   By sending different information to different players, things can get
   extremely biased.

   Last paragraph "Noar" -> "Naor" (twice and then several times on page 11.
   Essentially, do a search and replace on "Noar" on the entire document.)

   2nd paragraph: What's a "commitment to a seed"?

   "If, then"

   2nd paragraph: Where is the private key in this scheme?  The players have
   shares of the seed, shares of the secret, and a public key.

   You should make the paragraph following Lemma 4 a proof of Lemma 4.
   Otherwise the reader thinks Lemma 4 is given without proof.

** Page 33 (***)

   I'm missing something in the proof of Lemma 5.  We have the probability alpha
   that the current round is the definitive round and the probability gamma that
   the current round is the last round of the short player.  So how does this
   give a probability of gamma/alpha for the short case?

   Lemma 7: What does it mean for the short player to be present?

** Page 35

   "If, then" (Last time I comment on this.  There are several subsequent pages
   where this should also be fixed.)

   In Lemma 13, isn't the bound on the maximum temptation true also for larger
   coalitions?  Aah, I see.  Lemma 14 covers this case.  You may want to say
   before Lemma 13 that Lemmas 13 and 14 cover these separate cases.

** Page 39 (***)

   What do you mean by unbounded players being able to compute the bad cases?

   1/p for a probability is a really bad choice because "p = probability".

   Bottom: |F| should be |\mathbb{F}|.

   Another typographic comment: All logs in your thesis should be "\lg" or
   "\log" (and you should be consistent about using one or the other to denote
   log-base-2).  This introduces the correct spacing and typesets the log in
   roman font, as it should be.

** Page 40 (****)

   I buy your argument that you need unbounded entropy to guard against
   unbounded opponents.  However, why is a short round necessary if all entropy
   comes from the dealer?  Do you assume the dealer is non-interacting here too?
   (In that case, I buy your argument.  Otherwise it seems like the dealer can
   simply distribute new messages for the next round on the fly.)

* Chapter 4: Asynchronous Broadcast
** Page 42 (**)

   How do receivers detect that no message was sent?  Do you assume a time-out
   or is there a more reliable way to check that no message was sent?

** Page 43 (**)

   "More than a strict majority of players can learn the secret."  Do you mean
   more players than what would constitute a strict majority or do you mean
   "more cases" than when a strict majority learns the secret, i.e., a number of
   players not constituting a strict majority could also learn the secret?

   Alright, I get what this says now, but the phrase "more than a strict
   majority" is really weird.  More than the smallest number that is a strict
   majority is still a strict majority.  So you cannot have more players than a
   strict majority.

** Page 44/45 (****)

   Can you explain to me what it means to be immune to a rational coalition.
   You defined this to mean that the players in the coalition cooperate until
   they learn the secret.  Your proof does not say anything about the coalition
   defecting before they learn the secret.  So I'm confused.  Overall, something
   is off with the logic in this proof.  I'm simply not following.

   How can m(p,r) not decrease in a given round?  Essentially this means the
   player does not learn anything in the given round.  Can you explain?

** Page 49 (****)

   I'm missing something trivial here, I guess.  How does the protocol achieve
   the offsets of when players start to receive definitive shares?

** Page 51

   Spacing problem before "(mod n)".  Did you use "\bmod"?  Try "\mod".

** Page 53

   It's unclear what the different paragraphs in the proof of Lemma 27 argue.
   It seems like the first paragraph argues that it is possible to decrease the
   count by 2 and that the other two paragraphs argue that the count cannot
   decrease by more than two.  This should be made clearer.
