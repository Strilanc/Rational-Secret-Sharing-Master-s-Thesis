	abstract = {We present a new and very simple commitment scheme that does not depend on any assumptions about computational complexity ? the Sender and Receiver may both be computationally unbounded. Instead, the scheme utilizes a \trusted initializer &amp;quot; who participates only in an initial setup phase. The scheme also utilizes private channels between each pair of parties. The Sender is able to easily commit to a large value ? the scheme is not just a \bit-commitment &amp;quot; scheme. We also observe that 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer is easily handled in the same model, using a simple OT protocol due to Bennett et al.[2].},

   abstract = {This paper introduces the Repeated Rational Secret Sharing problem. We borrow the notion of rational secret sharing from Halpern and Teague[1], where players prefer to get the secret than not to get the secret and with lower preference, prefer that as few of the other players get the secret. We introduce the concept of repeated games in the rational secret sharing problem for the first time, which enables the possibility of a deterministic protocol for solving this problem. This is the first approach in this direction to the best of our knowledge. We extend the results for the mixed model (synchronous) where at most t players can be malicious. We also propose the first asynchronous protocol for rational secret sharing.},
